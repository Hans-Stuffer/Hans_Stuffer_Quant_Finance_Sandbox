##  Project overview:

*SMA Momentum trading:*
- Implements a **fast / slow SMA** crossover trading logic  
- Backtests signals vs. a buy-and-hold benchmark  
- Calculates performance metrics (e.g. cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio)  
- Produces visualizations to compare strategy vs benchmark  

## In upcoming commits, I plan to explore:

- Mean reversion / range strategies  
- Volatility scaled position sizing  
- Factor modeling & multi-factor combination  
- Machine learning / signal generation  
- Portfolio optimization & risk-parity  
- Transaction costs, slippage, walk-forward testing

## Tech Stack & Dependencies

- **Python 3.10+**  
- **pandas**, **numpy**  
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** (for plotting)  
- (Optional) **yfinance**, **pandas_datareader** for data ingestion

## Purpose & Philosophy

This is a **learning sandbox**, not a production trading engine.  
The goal is to:

- Solidify my understanding of quantitative finance building blocks  
- Practice reproducible research and clean code structure  
- Iterate quickly on ideas, learn from failures  
- Build toward more advanced quant research tools
